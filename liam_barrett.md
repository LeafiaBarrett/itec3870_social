###iv. Favorite movie
  I don't really watch TV or read nowadays :tongue:
  
###v. Favorite video game
  It's a toss-up between Super Smash Brothers 4 and Splatoon. I'm a fan of platformers, and Smash Bros has a huge variety of Nintendo characters. On the other hand, Splatoon is really unique for a third-person shooter, and is just cute overall. :boom:

###vi. Favorite pet
  Cats. :smile:
